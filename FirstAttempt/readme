// This folder contains the code from the intial lab submission. This code is ineffective and accomplishes only some of the goals of the lab. Updates will be made and documented, and committed to the 'Updates' folder.
// Once the lab is working as desired according to the instructions, the code will be committed to the 'Final' folder. Both the 'Updates' and 'Final' folders will contain readme files explaining the changes that
// have been made to improve the efficacy of the code. Most of this information will also be included in an updated version of the lab report, which will explore troubleshooting steps and the logical operation of
// the code in more depth.
